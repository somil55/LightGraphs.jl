Edges may also be accessed via an iterator that yields \nEdge\n types containing \n(src::Int, dst::Int)\n values.\n\n\nLightGraphs.jl\n provides two graph types: \nGraph\n is an undirected graph, and \nDiGraph\n is its directed counterpart.\n\n\nGraphs are created using \nGraph()\n or \nDiGraph()\n; there are several options (see below for examples).\n\n\nEdges are added to a graph using \nadd_edge!(g, e)\n. Instead of an edge type integers may be passed denoting the source and destination vertices (e.g., \nadd_edge!(g, 1, 2)\n).\n\n\nMultiple edges between two given vertices are not allowed: an attempt to add an edge that already exists in a graph will result in a silent failure.\n\n\nEdges may be removed using \nrem_edge!(g, e)\n. Alternately, integers may be passed denoting the source and destination vertices (e.g., \nrem_edge!(g, 1, 2)\n). Note that, particularly for very large graphs, edge removal is a (relatively) expensive operation. An attempt to remove an edge that does not exist in the graph will result in an error.\n\n\nUse \nnv(g)\n and \nne(g)\n to compute the number of vertices and edges respectively.\n\n\nrem_vertex!(g, v)\n alters the vertex identifiers. In particular, calling \nn=nv(g)\n, it swaps \nv\n and \nn\n and then removes \nn\n.\n\n\nedges(g)\n returns an iterator to the edge set.
